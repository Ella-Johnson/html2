        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>Shelby Wild, founder of California Naturals, grew up on the coast, the Gulf of Mississippi, with a family who managed to do a lot with a little. She spent her childhood under the sun; swimming in rivers, surfing warm waves, running through creeks, and climbing Cypress trees. When she wasn't outdoors, she played scientist, (just like her Dad), making and mixing ingredients in her family's kitchen.</p>
        <p>At 20, Shelby moved to New York and began styling for Vogue. At the pinnacle of the fashion world, Shelby quickly found that prestige hair and beauty products were two things: overpriced and overrated. So in her cramped East Village kitchen, she started experimenting again. Her obsession with herbalism and product creation grew and grew, and her efforts were so successful she landed a line of products in Sephora.</p>
        <p>But something still didn't feel right. These products weren't accessible to the people she wanted to reach: the little girls, boys, and their families swimming and climbing under the sun, all across the United States. So, Shelby decided to make another radical decision: One that would bring her closer to the sun and the natural landscapes she'd been missing in New York City - She moved to California.</p>
